# Contributing
We in SDL always value collaboration internally and externally. We would like to invite you to collaborate with us. 

Collaborating is as simple as creating a Fork of one of our open source projects. When you contribution is ready simply create a pull request against the original repository. The repository owners in SDL will review your change and if all is well we will merge it in the repository.
