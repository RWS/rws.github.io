The framework was developed as an alternative for the Microsoft .NET OData v4 implementation which requires an operational Windows Stack. The SDL OData v4 framework offers the power to quickly bootstrap your own OData v4 Webservice in a platform agnostic way. You create your own domain model and Datasource adapter the framework does the rest for you. The framework is based around the latest in the technology field Java 8, Scala and Akka.
