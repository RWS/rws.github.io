# Publish an App Version on the AppStore

Publishing to the RWS AppStore makes your app discoverable to thousands of RWS users worldwide. This process includes validation, proper signing, and listing creation to ensure a professional presentation of your solution.


## What You Need to Provide

Send an email to [AppStore Support](mailto:app-signing@rws.com) with the subject: **Publish App on AppStore**: `<App Name> v<Version>`  
Include the following `required information` in the email body:  

| Item | Description | Example/Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Download Link** | Share link to app package | OneDrive, SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox (no email attachments) |
| **App Name** | Name for publication | Must match plugin/add-on manifest |
| **App Version** | Version number | Must match plugin/add-on manifest |
| **Supported Products** | Target RWS products | "Trados Studio", "Trados Cloud", "Language Weaver", "Tridion", etc. |
| **App Logo** | App icon/logo | 512 x 512 PNG recommended |
| **App Description** | User-focused description | Include both short summary and longer description if available |
| **Support Contact** | Support information | Email address or support portal URL |
| **Changelog** | Release notes | Link to changelog or include highlights in email |
| **Pricing** | Pricing model | Free or paid (include pricing model and purchase URL if paid) |
| **Publication Target** | Where to publish | RWS AppStore (public): Yes/No<br>Private AppStore: Yes/No |

### Optional Assets

If available, you can also include:
- Screenshots for the listing page
- Any specific installation or configuration instructions you want visible on the listing
- A link to your privacy policy (recommended if your solution processes user data)

## What Happens Next

**Validation:** We verify the package, check basic metadata (name, version, supported product), and may sign the plugin if required.

**Follow-up:** If anything is unclear or missing, we will contact you for clarification.

**Publication:** Once confirmed, we will publish the new listing or update the existing one and share the AppStore URL and/or private endpoint link.

## Timelines

Provided all required information is available, publication is typically completed within **48 hours**.

## Updating an Existing Listing

- Email subject: **Update App on AppStore**: `<App Name> v<Version>`
- Include a new download link, updated version, and release notes
- Mention any metadata changes (logo, description, support contact, pricing, visibility)
- The version number must be higher than the currently published version

## Tips to Avoid Delays

- Ensure the app name and version match the manifest
- Provide an accessible download link (no passwords, or include credentials if needed)
- Include the 512 x 512 logo and support contact details
- For Trados Studio plugins, ensure the package installs cleanly in the supported Studio version(s)
