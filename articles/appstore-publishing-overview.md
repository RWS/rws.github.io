## AppStore Publishing Guide

RWS provides several pathways for developers to distribute their applications and plugins to the [RWS Developer Community](https://community.rws.com/developers-more/). Whether you're building plugins for **Trados Studio**, add-ons for **Trados Cloud**, or integrations with **Language Weaver**, **Tridion** etc..., this guide will help you navigate the current publishing process.  

### Current Publishing Process

Until our new self-service platform becomes available, the RWS team manages app publication and signing on behalf of developers. This ensures quality control and proper code signing for all distributed applications.

**Available Services:**
- **[Publish Apps on the AppStore](publish-app-appstore.md)** - Distribute your apps publicly or privately through the RWS AppStore
- **[Sign Plugins for Private Distribution](sign-plugin-private.md)** - Get your Trados Studio plugins properly signed for direct distribution
- **[Request a Developer License](developer_license.md)** - Obtain the necessary licenses to develop with Trados APIs

### What's Coming: AppStore Manager

We're developing **AppStore Manager**, a self-service platform that will empower developers to:
- Manage their own developer profiles
- Sign and publish apps independently
- Control app visibility and distribution settings
- Update listings and versions on-demand

**Current Status:** AppStore Manager is in beta testing. [Learn more about the beta program](appstore-manager-beta.md).
