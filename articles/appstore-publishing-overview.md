## AppStore Publishing Guide

RWS provides several pathways for developers to distribute their applications and integrations across our product ecosystem. Whether you're building **Studio plugins**, **Cloud add-ons**, **Language Weaver integrations**, **Tridion extensions**, or solutions for other **RWS products**, this guide will help you navigate the current publishing process. 

### Current Publishing Process

Until our new self-service platform becomes available, the RWS team manages app publication and signing on behalf of developers. This ensures quality control and proper code signing for all distributed applications.

**Available Services:**
- **[Publish Apps on the AppStore](publish-app-appstore.md)** - Distribute your apps publicly or privately through the RWS AppStore
- **[Sign Plugins for Private Distribution](sign-plugin-private.md)** - Get your Trados Studio plugins properly signed for direct distribution
- **[Request a Developer License](developer_license.md)** - Obtain necessary licenses and API credentials

### What's Coming: AppStore Manager

We're developing **AppStore Manager**, a self-service platform that will empower developers to:
- Manage their own developer profiles
- Sign and publish apps independently
- Control app visibility and distribution settings
- Update listings and versions on-demand

**Current Status:** AppStore Manager is in beta testing. [Learn more about the beta program](appstore-manager-beta.md).


## Getting Started

1. **Determine your target product(s)** - Identify which RWS products your solution will integrate with
2. **Obtain developer access** - Request licenses or API credentials as needed
3. **Build your solution** - Use our APIs and SDKs to create your application
4. **Choose distribution method** - Public AppStore, private distribution, or custom endpoint
5. **Submit for publication** - Follow our current process or join the beta program
