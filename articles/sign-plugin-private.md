# Sign a Plugin for Private Distribution

If you plan to distribute a Trados Studio plugin privately (outside the public AppStore), RWS can sign your plugin so it installs smoothly in supported versions of Trados Studio and is trusted by the application. After signing, you can distribute the plugin directly or via a Private AppStore endpoint.

## Request Plugin Signing

Send an email to [AppStore Support](mailto:app-signing@rws.com) with the subject: **Sign Plugin**: `<Plugin Name> v<Version>`  
Include the following `required information` in the email body:  

| Item | Description | Example/Notes |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Download Link** | Share link to unsigned plugin | OneDrive, SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox (no email attachments) |
| **Plugin Name** | Name of plugin | Must match plugin manifest |
| **Plugin Version** | Version number | Must match plugin manifest |
| **Supported Products** | Target Trados products | "Trados Studio 2024" or "Trados Team/Enterprise (Cloud)" |
| **Plugin Description** | Brief purpose description | *Optional but recommended* - helps validate metadata |
| **Distribution Notes** | Special requirements | *Optional* - e.g., need Private AppStore endpoint |

## Delivery Preferences

**Default delivery:** We will provide you with a secure download link to the signed plugin once ready.

**Custom delivery:** If you prefer us to upload the signed plugin to a specific location you manage, include:
- Destination details
- Any required credentials

## What Happens Next

**Validation:** We verify the plugin structure and metadata and run basic checks.

**Signing:** We sign the plugin and prepare it for distribution.

**Delivery:** We share the signed plugin link or upload it to your preferred location.

## Timelines

Provided all required information is available, signing is typically completed within **48 hours**.

## Important Notes

> [!NOTE]
> **One signed build per version:** Each new build or version requires a new signing request.

> [!TIP]
> **Installation:** End users can install the signed plugin using the standard Trados Studio plugin installation process.

> [!TIP]
> **Private AppStore option:** If you want to distribute through a Private AppStore endpoint (so users can discover and install directly from within Trados Studio), indicate this in your email. We can provision a unique endpoint and share the URL with you.

## Distribution Options After Signing
### Direct Distribution
- Share the signed plugin file directly with your users
- Users install via Trados Studio's standard plugin installation process

### Private AppStore Endpoint
- Request a private AppStore URL during the signing process
- Users can discover and install your plugin directly from within Trados Studio
- Maintains the familiar AppStore experience for your users
