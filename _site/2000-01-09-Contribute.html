<h1 id="contributing">Contributing</h1>
<p>We in SDL always value collaboration internally and externally. We would like to invite you to collaborate with us.</p>

<p>Collaborating is as simple as creating a Fork of one of our open source projects. When you contribution is ready simply create a pull request against the original repository. The repository owners in SDL will review your change and if all is well we will merge it in the repository.</p>
